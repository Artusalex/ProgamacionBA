    <p>The Mark IX (Mark 9) is a Fully-Loaded Advanced Flight Prototype, and was the ninth suit created by Tony Stark, to surpass the Mark VIII, sometime after the events of The Avengers. The Mark 9 is also one of the most famous suits in the MCU.

    It was featured in the movie Iron Man 3, and made its debut in the movie when Tony ordered J.A.R.V.I.S. to initiate the "House Party Protocol", in which it was activated along with all the other suits to aid Tony in his battle against Aldrich Killian.
            
    The suit was another basic Iron Man suit, that was created by Tony. Bearing much resemblance to it's predecessor, it retains the famous gold and red color scheme, that takes the identity of Iron Man, with the exception of the redesigned colored plates and the rough-edged mask, a feature that is unique with the suit.
            
    It is equipped with a vast variety of weapons as well, and just like it's predecessors, retains the signature repulsor weapons that was used in the previous Mark suits.</p>
